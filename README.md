 The goal is to use this data for real-time descriptive analysis to extract  actionable insights about sales trends, customer behavior, employee performance, and  operational metrics.
“Using Walmart’s sales database, perform a real-time descriptive analysis to identify sales 
trends, customer purchasing behavior, and employee performance across different 
departments, states, and towns. The analysis should address: 
1. Sales Trends: 
o What is the total sales volume and revenue by day, week, and month? 
o Which products generate the highest revenue and which have the highest sales 
quantity? 
o Which departments contribute most to overall revenue? 
2. Customer Insights: 
o How many unique customers are active over time (daily, weekly, monthly)? 
o What are the most common payment methods used? 
o Which towns or states have the highest sales activity? 
3. Employee & Department Performance: 
o Which employees have the highest sales contribution? 
o How does employee performance vary across departments? 
o Is there a correlation between department sales and employee workload? 
4. Product-Department Relationship: 
o Compare price vs. quantity sold across departments. 
o Which products are fast-moving (high quantity, low price) vs. high-value (low 
quantity, high price)? 
5. Operational Metrics: 
o Average quantity per sale transaction. 
o Average revenue per customer. 
o Sales distribution by method of payment (cash, card, digital, etc.).
